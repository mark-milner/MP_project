# MP_project

the main branch will hold the official project code, documentation and citations. 

Sub branches will be created for each question and will allow each of us to work on different aspects of the project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

Pull requests: before any changes are made to the official main branch documents, pull requests can be used to notify everyone else of the change to ensure that any change is tested before merging to the main branch.

Issue tracking does what you would expect.
